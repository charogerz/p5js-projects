This project, we were tasked with creating an experimental clock -- one that told a time that meant something to our personal lives and that was different than what a typical clock would tell.
We were focused on learning if / else statements and millis() / second() / minute() / hour() time functions.
I made my clock with the idea of mealtimes, using real time progression for the clock to function and move.
