This project was for the Optical Illusion assignment in my Critical Computation course. We were each tasked with recreating a famous optical illusion in JavaScript.
I chose to focus on the scintillating grid illusion and added a red dot the moved across the pattern as the mouse moved to highlight the critical points of the illusion.
This helped us to learn more about how to use for loops and nested for loops.
