The Data Portrait project was probably my favorite one up to this point in my Critical Computation course. I used 7 days to collect data on myself and chose to track how many times each day I was playing with my hair, as this has been a nervous habit of mine for some time. I wanted to use this as an indicator of which days I felt my anxiety was worse than others. 
I used the moving shapes to represent my anxiety and allowed the user to change these in size and noise using the sliders at the bottom. Each day's data was represented by the appearing and disappearing lines around these shapes.
This was an assignment aimed at teaching us how to better use arrays and for loops.
